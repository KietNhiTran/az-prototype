type: group
short-summary: Rapidly create Azure prototypes using AI-driven agent teams.
long-summary: |
    The az prototype extension empowers you to build functional Azure prototypes
    using intelligent agent teams powered by GitHub Copilot or Azure OpenAI.

    Workflow: init → design → build → deploy

    Each stage can be run independently (with prerequisite guards) and most
    stages are re-entrant — you can return to refine your design or rebuild
    specific components.

    Analysis commands let you diagnose errors and estimate costs at any point.
"""

helps["prototype init"] = """
type: command
short-summary: Initialize a new prototype project.
long-summary: |
    Sets up project scaffolding, creates the project configuration file, and
    optionally authenticates with GitHub (validates Copilot license).

    GitHub authentication is only required for the copilot and github-models
    AI providers. When using azure-openai, GitHub auth is skipped entirely.

    If the target directory already contains a prototype.yaml, the command
    will prompt before overwriting.
examples:
    - name: Create a new prototype project
      text: az prototype init --name my-prototype --location eastus
    - name: Initialize with Bicep preference
      text: az prototype init --name my-app --location westus2 --iac-tool bicep
    - name: Use Azure OpenAI (skips GitHub auth)
      text: az prototype init --name my-app --location eastus --ai-provider azure-openai
    - name: Specify environment and model
      text: az prototype init --name my-app --location eastus --environment staging --model gpt-4o
"""

helps["prototype design"] = """
type: command
short-summary: Analyze requirements and generate architecture design.
long-summary: |
    Reads artifacts (documents, diagrams, specs), engages the biz-analyst
    agent to identify gaps, and generates architecture documentation.

    When run without parameters, starts an interactive dialogue to
    capture requirements through guided questions.

    With --interactive, enters a refinement loop after architecture
    generation so you can review the design and request changes.

    The biz-analyst agent is always engaged — even when --context is
    provided — to check for missing requirements and unstated assumptions.

    This stage is re-entrant — run it again to refine the design.
examples:
    - name: Interactive design session (guided dialogue)
      text: az prototype design
    - name: Interactive design with architecture refinement loop
      text: az prototype design --interactive
    - name: Design from artifact directory
      text: az prototype design --artifacts ./requirements/
    - name: Add context to existing design
      text: az prototype design --context "Add Redis caching layer"
    - name: Reset and start design fresh
      text: az prototype design --reset
"""

helps["prototype build"] = """
type: command
short-summary: Generate infrastructure and application code in staged output.
long-summary: |
    Uses the architecture design to generate Terraform/Bicep modules,
    application code, database scripts, and documentation.

    Interactive by default — the build session uses Claude Code-inspired
    bordered prompts, progress indicators, policy enforcement, and a
    conversational review loop.

    All output is organized into fine-grained, dependency-ordered
    deployment stages. Each infrastructure component, database system,
    and application gets its own stage. Workload templates are used
    as optional starting points when they match the design.

    After generation, a build report shows what was built and you can
    provide feedback to regenerate specific stages. Type 'done' to
    accept the build.

    Slash commands during build:
      /status  - Show stage completion summary
      /stages  - Show full deployment plan
      /files   - List all generated files
      /policy  - Show policy check summary
      /help    - Show available commands

    Use --dry-run for a non-interactive preview.
examples:
    - name: Interactive build session (default)
      text: az prototype build
    - name: Show current build progress
      text: az prototype build --status
    - name: Clear build state and start fresh
      text: az prototype build --reset

      text: az prototype build --scope infra
    - name: Preview what would be generated
      text: az prototype build --scope all --dry-run
"""

helps["prototype deploy"] = """
type: command
short-summary: Deploy prototype to Azure with interactive staged deployments.
long-summary: |
    Interactive by default — runs preflight checks (subscription, IaC tool,
    resource group, resource providers), then deploys stages sequentially
    with progress tracking and QA-first error routing.

    After deployment, enters a conversational loop where you can check
    status, rollback, redeploy, or preview changes using slash commands.

    Slash commands during deploy:
      /status    - Show stage completion summary
      /stages    - Show full stage breakdown (alias for /status)
      /deploy N  - Deploy a specific stage (or 'all' for pending)
      /rollback N - Roll back a specific stage (or 'all' in reverse order)
      /redeploy N - Roll back and redeploy a stage
      /plan N    - What-if / terraform plan for a stage
      /outputs   - Show captured deployment outputs
      /preflight - Re-run preflight checks
      /help      - Show available commands

    Use --dry-run for non-interactive what-if / terraform plan preview.
    Use --stage N for non-interactive single-stage deploy.
    Use --stage N --dry-run for what-if preview of a single stage.
    Use --outputs to show captured deployment outputs.
    Use --rollback-info to show rollback instructions.
    Use --generate-scripts to generate deploy.sh for application directories.
examples:
    - name: Interactive deploy session (default)
      text: az prototype deploy
    - name: Show current deploy progress
      text: az prototype deploy --status
    - name: Preview all stages (what-if / terraform plan)
      text: az prototype deploy --dry-run
    - name: Deploy only stage 2
      text: az prototype deploy --stage 2

      text: az prototype deploy --generate-scripts --script-type webapp
"""

helps["prototype status"] = """
type: command
short-summary: Show current project status across all stages.
long-summary: |
    Displays a summary of the prototype project including configuration,
    stage progress (design, build, deploy), and pending changes.

    By default shows a human-readable summary. Use --json for machine-readable
    output suitable for scripting. Use --detailed for expanded per-stage details.
examples:
    - name: Show project status
      text: az prototype status
    - name: Show detailed status with per-stage breakdown
      text: az prototype status --detailed
    - name: Get machine-readable JSON output

"""

helps["prototype analyze"] = """
type: group
short-summary: Analyze errors, costs, and diagnostics for the prototype.
long-summary: |
    Provides analysis capabilities powered by specialized AI agents.
    Use 'error' to diagnose and fix issues, or 'costs' to estimate
    Azure spending at different scale tiers.
"""

helps["prototype analyze error"] = """
type: command
short-summary: Analyze an error and get a fix with redeployment instructions.
long-summary: |
    Accepts an inline error string, log file path, or screenshot image.
    The QA engineer agent identifies the root cause, proposes a fix,
    and tells you which commands to run to redeploy.
examples:
    - name: Analyze an inline error message
      text: az prototype analyze error --input "ResourceNotFound - The Resource was not found"
    - name: Analyze a log file

"""

helps["prototype analyze costs"] = """
type: command
short-summary: Estimate Azure costs at Small/Medium/Large t-shirt sizes.
long-summary: |
    Analyzes the current architecture design, queries Azure Retail Prices
    API for each component, and produces a cost report with estimates
    at three consumption tiers.

    Results are cached in .prototype/state/cost_analysis.yaml. Re-running
    the command returns the cached result unless the design context has
    changed. Use --refresh to force a fresh analysis.
examples:
    - name: Show cost summary table (default)
      text: az prototype analyze costs
    - name: Show cost summary table only (no file save)
      text: az prototype analyze costs --table

type: group
short-summary: Manage prototype project configuration.
"""

helps["prototype config init"] = """
type: command
short-summary: Interactive setup to create a prototype.yaml configuration file.
long-summary: |
    Walks through standard project questions (name, region, IaC tool,
    naming strategy, AI provider, etc.) and generates a prototype.yaml file.

    Naming strategies control how Azure resources are named:
      - microsoft-alz (default): Azure Landing Zone — {zoneid}-{type}-{service}-{env}-{region}
      - microsoft-caf:           Cloud Adoption Framework — {type}-{org}-{service}-{env}-{region}-{instance}
      - simple:                  Quick prototypes — {org}-{service}-{type}-{env}
      - enterprise:              Business unit scoped — {type}-{bu}-{org}-{service}-{env}-{region}-{instance}
      - custom:                  User-defined pattern

    The configuration file is optional — all settings can also be
    provided via command-line parameters.
examples:
    - name: Start interactive configuration
      text: az prototype config init
    - name: Set naming strategy after init
      text: az prototype config set --key naming.strategy --value microsoft-caf

    reviewed and merged into the shared knowledge base so future sessions
    benefit from community findings.
"""

helps["prototype knowledge contribute"] = """
type: command
short-summary: Submit a knowledge base contribution as a GitHub Issue.
long-summary: |
    Creates a structured GitHub Issue in the knowledge repository when a
    pattern, pitfall, or service gap is discovered.

    Interactive by default — walks through type, section, context, rationale,
    and content.  Non-interactive when --service and --description are provided.

    Use --draft to preview the contribution without submitting (skips gh auth).
    Use --file to load contribution content from a file.
examples:

"""

helps["prototype agent"] = """
type: group
short-summary: Manage AI agents for prototype generation.
long-summary: |
    Agents are specialized AI personas that handle different aspects of
    prototype generation. Built-in agents ship with the extension; you can

    Built-in agents: cloud-architect, terraform, bicep, app-developer,
    documentation, qa-engineer, biz-analyst, cost-analyst, project-manager,
    security-reviewer, monitoring-agent

    Agent resolution order: custom > override > built-in.

    Use 'agent list' to see all available agents, 'agent add' to create
    custom agents, 'agent test' to validate an agent, and 'agent export'
    to share agent definitions.
"""

helps["prototype generate"] = """
type: group
short-summary: Generate documentation and spec-kit artifacts.
long-summary: |
    Commands for generating project documentation and specification-kit
    bundles from built-in templates.

    Templates are populated with project configuration values and written
    to the output directory. Remaining [PLACEHOLDER] values are left for
    AI agents to fill during the build stage.

    Document types generated:
      - ARCHITECTURE.md:    High-level and detailed architecture diagrams
      - DEPLOYMENT.md:      Step-by-step deployment guide

"""

helps["prototype generate backlog"] = """
type: command
short-summary: Generate a backlog and push work items to GitHub or Azure DevOps.
long-summary: |
    Interactive by default — generates a structured backlog from the architecture
    design and enters a conversational session where you can review, refine, add,
    update, and remove items before pushing them to your provider.

    GitHub mode creates issues with checkbox task lists in the description.
    Azure DevOps mode creates Features with User Stories and Tasks.

    Scope-aware: in-scope items become stories, out-of-scope items are excluded,
    and deferred items get a separate "Deferred / Future Work" epic.

    Slash commands during session:
      /list       - Show all items grouped by epic
      /show N     - Show item N with full details
      /add        - Add a new item (AI-assisted)
      /remove N   - Remove item N
      /preview    - Show what will be pushed
      /save       - Save to concept/docs/BACKLOG.md
      /push       - Push all pending items to provider
      /push N     - Push specific item
      /status     - Show push status per item
      /help       - Show available commands
      /quit       - Exit session

    Use --quick for a lighter generate -> confirm -> push flow.
    Use --status to view current backlog state without starting a session.
    Use --refresh to force fresh AI generation.

    Backlog provider, org, and project can be set in prototype.yaml
    under the 'backlog' section so you don't have to pass them every time.
examples:
    - name: Interactive backlog session (default)
      text: az prototype generate backlog --provider github

"""

helps["prototype generate docs"] = """
type: command
short-summary: Generate documentation from templates with AI population.
long-summary: |
    Reads each documentation template, applies project configuration values
    (project name, location, date), and writes the resulting markdown files
    to the output directory.

    When a design context is available (from 'az prototype design'), the
    doc-agent fills remaining [PLACEHOLDER] values with real content from
    the architecture. Falls back to static templates if no design context

    the concept directory and serves as the starting point for all project
    documentation.

    When a design context is available (from 'az prototype design'), the
    doc-agent fills remaining [PLACEHOLDER] values with real content from

    Interactive by default — when neither --file nor --definition is provided,
    walks you through description, capabilities, constraints, system prompt,
    and optional few-shot examples.

    Non-interactive modes:
    - --definition copies a built-in agent's YAML as a starting point
