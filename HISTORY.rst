Release History
===============

0.2.1b5
+++++++

Backlog enrichment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Enriched backlog with full project context** — ``generate backlog``
  now loads build stages, deploy status, cost analysis, and stage
  completion (same context as spec-kit) for richer item generation.
* **Completed work items** — items for already-built/deployed stages are
  generated with ``status: done`` and grouped under a "Completed POC Work"
  epic, with tasks marked as done.
* **Production Readiness epic** — dedicated epic for POC-to-production
  work (SKU upgrades, networking, CI/CD, monitoring, DR), separate from
  generic "Deferred / Future Work".
* **Azure DevOps hierarchy** — generation prompt requests Feature → User
  Story → Task structure with ``children[]``; push code now creates Task
  work items linked to their parent User Story.
* **Dict task format** — tasks can be ``{"title": "...", "done": true}``
  objects; GitHub issues render completed tasks as ``[x]``, DevOps
  descriptions show checkbox markers.  String tasks remain supported.

Spec-kit enrichment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Enriched spec-kit with full project context** — ``generate speckit``
  now loads discovery state, build stages, deploy status, cost analysis,
  and stage completion to populate templates with real project data.
* **Per-template prompt overrides** — each spec-kit template gets a
  tailored AI prompt that tells the doc-agent exactly which context
  sections to use and what output format to produce.
* **production.md** — new template covering POC-to-production guidance:
  SKU upgrades, networking, CI/CD, monitoring, DR, load testing, and
  estimated production costs.
* **Restructured tasks.md** — tasks now map 1:1 to build/deploy stages
  with status markers: ``[x]`` completed, ``[!]`` failed, ``[ ]`` pending.
  Added Phase 6 (Production Readiness) for hardening tasks.

Init improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Removed eager directory creation from init** — ``concept/apps/``,
  ``concept/infra/`` (terraform/, bicep/), and ``concept/db/`` (sql/,
  cosmos/, databricks/, fabric/) are no longer created during
  ``az prototype init``.  These directories are now created on demand
  by the build stage only when they are actually needed.
* **Fixed --output-dir nesting** — ``--output-dir ./my-output`` now
  uses the specified directory as the project root instead of creating
  a ``name/`` subdirectory inside it.
* **Fixed "Next: cd ..." hint** — the summary panel now shows the
  actual project directory name instead of always displaying the
  ``--name`` value.
* **--json flag on all commands** — added ``json_output`` parameter to
  every command function so the global ``--json`` / ``-j`` flag is
  accepted on all 24 commands (previously only 3 accepted it).
* **Naming env/zone_id derived from --environment** — ``naming.env``
  and ``naming.zone_id`` in ``prototype.yaml`` now reflect the chosen
  environment (dev→dev/zd, staging→stg/zs, prod→prd/zp) instead of
  always defaulting to ``dev``/``zd``.

TUI stage tree fix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Fixed stage tree showing completed checkmark for unstarted stages** —
  when launching with ``--stage design`` from an init-only project, the
  Design stage now correctly shows as in-progress (●) instead of
  completed (✓).  Stage status is now derived from detected state files,
  not the target stage.
* **Stage skip guard** — ``--stage deploy`` from an init-only project
  now prints a warning and falls back to the next valid stage (e.g.
  design) instead of allowing users to skip ahead.
* **Consistent "no project" error message** — all commands now show the
  same red ``CLIError`` message when ``prototype.yaml`` is missing:
  *"No prototype project found. Run 'az prototype init'."*
* **Replaced ``--output-format`` with ``--table`` / ``--report``** — the
  ``analyze costs`` command shows the cost summary table by default,
  ``--table`` shows the summary without saving a file, ``--report``
  shows the full detailed report, and ``--json`` returns raw JSON.
  The ``generate backlog`` command uses ``--table`` instead of
  ``--output-format``.
* **``--json`` on cost analysis returns full content** — ``--json`` now
  suppresses console output and returns a structured JSON dict with the
  full cost report in the ``content`` field for machine consumption.
* **``generate docs`` default output moved to ``concept/docs/``** —
  documentation is now generated alongside other concept artifacts
  instead of a separate ``docs/`` directory at the project root.
* **Normalized path separators in generate output** — displayed paths
  now use forward slashes on all platforms instead of mixed separators
  on Windows.  Also handles cross-mount ``--path`` values (e.g.
  ``Y:\output`` from a ``\\Mac\projects`` project) without crashing.
* **Spec-kit generates its own templates** — ``generate speckit`` now
  produces spec-kit-specific files (``constitution.md``, ``spec.md``,
  ``plan.md``, ``tasks.md``) aligned with the `spec-kit
  <https://github.com/github/spec-kit>`_ format instead of duplicating
  the documentation templates.

TUI post-design improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Removed CLI "Next steps" from TUI** — the ``az prototype`` CLI
  commands block is no longer printed into the TUI console after
  architecture generation; replaced with a continuation prompt.
* **"continue" launches build** — typing ``continue`` after design
  completes now starts the build stage, matching the prompt text.
* **Reduced console noise** — removed extra blank lines between
  "Planning...", "Generating architecture...", and feasibility
  check messages in the TUI output.
* **Feasibility wording** — changed "Reviewing {iac} feasibility..."
  to "Confirming {iac} feasibility..." and removed the arrow prefix.

0.2.1b4
+++++++

Discovery section gating and architecture task tracking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Reliable section completion gate** — replaced heuristic phrase
  matching (``_is_section_done()``) with an explicit AI confirmation
  step.  Sections only advance when the AI responds with "Yes",
  eliminating false-positive checkmarks from transitional language.
* **"All topics covered" accuracy** — the message now only appears
  when every section received explicit AI confirmation.  Otherwise a
  softer prompt is shown.
* **"continue" keyword** — users can type ``continue`` (in addition
  to ``done``) to proceed from discovery to architecture generation.
* **Architecture sections in task tree** — ``_generate_architecture_sections()``
  now reports each section to the TUI task tree with ``in_progress`` /
  ``completed`` status updates.  Dynamically discovered sections
  (``[NEW_SECTION]`` markers) are appended in real time.
* **Timer format** — elapsed times >= 60 s now display as ``1m04s``
  instead of ``64s`` in the TUI info bar and per-section console
  output.

TUI console color, wrapping, and section pagination
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Color consolidation** — all color constants now live in ``theme.py``
  as the single source of truth.  Duplicate theme dicts in ``console.py``
  and hardcoded hex colors in ``task_tree.py``, ``tui_adapter.py``, and
  ``console.py`` toolbar functions replaced with ``COLORS`` imports.
* **Rich markup preservation** — ``TUIAdapter.print_fn()`` no longer
  strips Rich markup tags.  Messages containing ``[success]``,
  ``[info]``, etc. are routed to the new ``ConsoleView.write_markup()``
  method so status messages retain their colors in the TUI.
* **Horizontal wrapping** — ``ConsoleView`` (``RichLog``) now passes
  ``wrap=True``, eliminating the horizontal scrollbar for long lines.
* **Agent response rendering** — new ``TUIAdapter.response_fn()``
  renders agent responses as colored Markdown via
  ``ConsoleView.write_agent_response()``.  Wired through
  ``DiscoverySession.run()`` → ``DesignStage.execute()`` →
  ``StageOrchestrator._run_design()``.
* **Section pagination** — multi-section agent responses (split on
  ``## `` headings) are shown one section at a time with an "Enter to
  continue" prompt between them.  Single-section responses render all
  at once.
* **Empty submit support** — ``PromptInput.enable(allow_empty=True)``
  allows submitting with no text, used by the pagination "Enter to
  continue" prompt.  Empty submissions are not echoed to the console.
* **Clean Ctrl+C exit** — ``_run_tui()`` helper in ``custom.py``
  suppresses ``SIGINT`` during the Textual run so Ctrl+C is handled
  exclusively as a key event.  Prevents ``KeyboardInterrupt`` from
  propagating to the Azure CLI framework and eliminates the Windows
  "Terminate batch job (Y/N)?" prompt from ``az.cmd``.

Build-deploy stage decoupling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Stable stage IDs** — build stages now carry a persistent ``id``
  field (slug derived from name, e.g. ``"data-layer"``).  IDs survive
  renumbering, stage insertion/removal, and design iteration.  Legacy
  state files are backfilled on load.
* **Build-deploy correspondence** — deploy stages link back to build
  stages via ``build_stage_id`` instead of fragile stage numbers.
  ``sync_from_build_state()`` performs smart reconciliation: matching
  stages are updated while preserving deploy progress, new build stages
  create new deploy stages, and removed build stages are marked
  ``"removed"``.
* **Stage splitting** — ``split_stage(N, substages)`` replaces one
  deploy stage with N substages (``5a``, ``5b``, ``5c``) sharing the
  same ``build_stage_id``.  Supports code splits (Type A), deploy-only
  splits (Type B), and manual step insertion (Type C).
* **Manual deployment steps** — stages with ``deploy_mode: "manual"``
  display instructions and pause for user confirmation (Done / Skip /
  Need help) instead of executing IaC commands.  Manual steps can
  originate from the architect during plan derivation or from
  remediation.
* **New deploy statuses** — ``"removed"`` (build stage deleted),
  ``"destroyed"`` (resources torn down), ``"awaiting_manual"`` (waiting
  for user confirmation).
* **New slash commands** — ``/split N`` (interactive stage splitting),
  ``/destroy N`` (resource destruction with confirmation),
  ``/manual N "instructions"`` (add/view manual step instructions).
* **Compound stage references** — all stage-referencing commands
  (``/deploy``, ``/rollback``, ``/redeploy``, ``/plan``, ``/describe``)
  accept substage labels: ``/deploy 5a``, ``/rollback 5`` (all
  substages in reverse order).
* **Re-entry sync** — when the deploy session re-enters with an
  existing deploy state, it syncs with the latest build state and
  reports changes (new stages, removed stages, updated code).
* **Display improvements** — removed stages show with strikethrough and
  ``(Removed)`` suffix, manual steps show ``[Manual]`` badge, substages
  display compound IDs (``2a``, ``2b``).

Deploy auto-remediation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Automatic deploy failure remediation** — when a deployment stage
  fails, the system now automatically diagnoses (QA engineer),
  determines a fix strategy (cloud architect), regenerates the code
  (IaC/app agent), and retries deployment — up to 2 remediation
  attempts before falling through to the interactive loop.
* **Downstream impact tracking** — after fixing a stage, the
  architect checks whether downstream stages need regeneration
  due to changed outputs or dependencies.  Affected stages are
  automatically regenerated before their deploy.
* **Consistent QA routing** — ``/deploy N`` and ``/redeploy N``
  slash commands now route through the remediation loop on failure,
  not just print the error.
* **Deploy state enhancements** — new ``remediating`` status,
  per-stage ``remediation_attempts`` counter, ``add_patch_stages()``,
  and ``renumber_stages()`` methods.

Incremental build stage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Design change detection** — ``BuildState`` now stores a design
  snapshot (architecture hash + full text) after each build.  On
  re-entry, the build session compares the current design against the
  snapshot to determine whether regeneration is needed.
* **Three-branch Phase 2** — the deployment plan derivation phase now
  has three paths:

  - **Branch A** (first build): derive a fresh plan and save the
    design snapshot.
  - **Branch B** (design changed): ask the architect agent to diff the
    old and new architectures, classify each stage as unchanged /
    modified / removed, identify new services, and apply targeted
    updates (``mark_stages_stale``, ``remove_stages``, ``add_stages``).
    When ``plan_restructured`` is flagged, the user is offered a full
    plan re-derive.
  - **Branch C** (no changes): report "Build is up to date" and skip
    directly to the review loop.

* **Incremental stage operations** on ``BuildState``:
  ``set_design_snapshot()``, ``design_has_changed()``,
  ``get_previous_architecture()``, ``mark_stages_stale()``,
  ``remove_stages()``, ``add_stages()``, ``renumber_stages()``.
* **Architecture diff via architect agent** —
  ``_diff_architectures()`` sends old/new architecture + existing
  stages to the architect, parses JSON classification, and falls back
  to marking all stages as modified when the architect is unavailable.
* **Legacy build compatibility** — builds without a design snapshot
  (pre-incremental) are treated as "design changed" with all stages
  marked for rebuild, preserving conversation history.

TUI dashboard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Added Textual TUI dashboard** — ``az prototype launch`` opens a full
  terminal UI with four panels: scrollable console output (RichLog),
  collapsible task tree with async status updates, growable multi-line
  prompt (Enter to submit, Shift+Enter for newline), and an info bar
  showing assist text and token usage.
* **Stage orchestrator** — the TUI auto-detects the current project stage
  from ``.prototype/state/`` files and launches the appropriate session.
  Users can navigate between design, build, and deploy without exiting.
* **Session-TUI bridge** — ``TUIAdapter`` connects synchronous sessions to
  the async Textual event loop using ``call_from_thread`` and
  ``threading.Event``.  Sessions run on worker threads with ``input_fn``
  and ``print_fn`` routed through TUI widgets.
* **Spinner → task tree** — ``_maybe_spinner`` on all four sessions
  (discovery, build, deploy, backlog) now accepts a ``status_fn`` callback
  so the TUI can show progress via the info bar instead of Rich spinners.
* **Guarded console calls** — discovery slash commands (``/open``,
  ``/status``, ``/why``, ``/summary``, ``/restart``, ``/help``) and
  design stage header now route through ``_print`` when ``input_fn`` /
  ``print_fn`` are injected, preventing Rich output conflicts in TUI mode.
* **New dependency** — ``textual>=8.0.0``.
* **Design command launches TUI** — ``az prototype design`` now opens the
  TUI dashboard and auto-starts the design session, instead of running
  synchronously in the terminal.  ``--status`` remains CLI-only.
  Artifact paths are resolved to absolute before the TUI takes over.
* **Section headers as tree branches** — during discovery, the
  biz-analyst's AI responses are scanned for ``##`` / ``###`` headings
  (e.g. "Project Context & Scope", "Data & Content") which appear as
  collapsible sub-nodes under the Design branch in the task tree.
  Duplicate headings are deduplicated by slug.

Natural language intent detection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **AI-powered command classification** — all four interactive sessions
  (discovery, build, deploy, backlog) now accept natural language
  instead of slash commands.  When an AI provider is available, a
  lightweight classification call maps user input to the appropriate
  command.  Falls back to keyword/regex scoring when AI is unavailable.
* **Mid-session file reading** — ``"read artifacts from <path>"``
  reads files (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, images, text) during any session and
  injects the content into the conversation context.
* **Deploy session natural language** — the deploy session no longer
  requires slash commands.  ``"deploy stage 3"``, ``"rollback all"``,
  ``"deploy stages 3 and 4"`` are interpreted and executed directly.
* **Stage description command** — new ``/describe N`` command in both
  build and deploy sessions.  Natural language variants like
  ``"describe stage 3"`` or ``"what's being deployed in stage 2"``
  show detailed resource, file, and status information for a stage.
* **Project summary in TUI** — the welcome banner now shows a
  one-line project summary extracted from discovery state or the
  design architecture.

Packaging
~~~~~~~~~~
* **Added ``__init__.py`` to data-only directories** — 15 data directories
  (policies, standards, templates, knowledge, agent definitions) lacked
  ``__init__.py``, causing setuptools "Package would be ignored" warnings
  during wheel builds.  The ``templates/`` directory also contained Python
  modules (``registry.py``, ``validate.py``) that were not included in the
  wheel.  All data directories now have ``__init__.py`` so ``find_packages()``
  discovers them correctly.
* **Excluded ``__pycache__`` from package discovery** — ``setup.py`` now
  filters ``__pycache__`` directories from ``find_packages()`` results to
  prevent spurious build warnings.

0.2.1b3
+++++++

Build stage
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Removed terraform validation from build** — ``terraform init`` and
  ``terraform validate`` no longer run during the build stage.  Build
  only generates code; the deploy stage is the correct place to validate
  and execute IaC tooling.  This removes the requirement for terraform
  to be installed at build time.

0.2.1b2
+++++++

_No changes._ Utility version bump for Azure CLI library deployment.

0.2.1b1
+++++++

Azure CLI extension index compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Renamed ``--verbose`` to ``--detailed``** — ``--verbose`` / ``-v`` is a
  reserved Azure CLI global argument.  The ``prototype status``,
  ``agent list``, and ``agent show`` commands now use ``--detailed`` / ``-d``
  instead.
* **Renamed ``--output`` to ``--output-file``** — ``--output`` / ``-o`` is a
  reserved Azure CLI global argument.  The ``agent export`` command now uses
  ``--output-file`` / ``-f`` instead.
* **Consolidated deploy subcommands into flags** — ``deploy outputs``,
  ``deploy rollback-info``, and ``deploy generate-scripts`` were subcommands
  that made ``deploy`` both a command and a command group, causing an
  argparse conflict on Python 3.13.  They are now flags on the single
  ``az prototype deploy`` command: ``--outputs``, ``--rollback-info``,
  ``--generate-scripts`` (with ``--script-type``, ``--script-resource-group``,
  ``--script-registry``).
* **Dropped non-PEP 440 version suffixes from wheel filenames** — release
  and CI pipelines no longer rename wheels with ``-preview`` or ``-ci.N``
  suffixes, which broke ``azdev linter`` filename validation.
* **Fixed ``publish-index`` idempotency** — the release pipeline now checks
  out an existing PR branch instead of failing on ``git checkout -b`` when
  the branch already exists.  PR creation falls back to ``gh api`` REST
  update when a PR already exists (avoids ``read:org`` scope requirement
  of ``gh pr edit`` GraphQL).
* **Excluded ``tests`` from wheel** — ``find_packages()`` now uses
  ``exclude=["tests", "tests.*"]`` to avoid packaging the test suite.

0.2.1-preview
++++++++++++++

Quiet output by default
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Suppressed JSON output** — all ``az prototype`` commands now return
  ``None`` by default, eliminating the verbose JSON dump that Azure CLI
  auto-serializes after every command.  Pass ``--json`` / ``-j`` to any
  command to restore machine-readable JSON output.
* **Global ``--json`` flag** — registered on the ``prototype`` parent
  command group so it is inherited by every subcommand without per-command
  boilerplate.
* **Console output for data commands** — ``config show`` prints
  YAML-formatted config, ``config get`` prints key/value pairs,
  ``config set`` confirms the new value, ``deploy outputs`` and
  ``deploy rollback-info`` print human-readable summaries when ``--json``
  is not supplied.

Build ``--reset`` directory cleanup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Clean generated output on reset** — ``az prototype build --reset``
  now removes the ``concept/infra``, ``concept/apps``, ``concept/db``,
  and ``concept/docs`` directories before regenerating.  Previously only
  the build state metadata was cleared, leaving stale files that could
  cause Terraform/Bicep deployment failures when merged with new output.

Test fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Updated model defaults** — test expectations aligned with the
  ``claude-sonnet-4`` default (was ``claude-sonnet-4.5``) and version
  ``0.2.0`` (was ``0.1.1``).
* **75+ test call-sites updated** — all tests that assert on command
  return values now pass ``json_output=True`` to work with the new
  quiet-output decorator.

0.2.0-preview
++++++++++++++

Azapi provider for Terraform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Switched from ``azurerm`` to ``azapi``** — all Terraform resources are now
  generated as ``azapi_resource`` with ARM resource types in the ``type``
  property (e.g. ``Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2025-06-01``).  This
  eliminates dependency on provider-specific resource schemas and gives
  day-zero coverage for any Azure service.
* **Centralized version constants** — ``requirements.py`` declares
  ``_AZURE_API_VERSION = "2025-06-01"`` and ``_AZAPI_PROVIDER_VERSION = "2.8.0"``
  with ``get_dependency_version()`` lookup.  Both agents read these at runtime.
* **Provider pin injection** — ``TerraformAgent.get_system_messages()`` injects
  the exact ``required_providers`` block with pinned ``azure/azapi ~> 2.8.0``
  into the agent's system context.
* **ARM REST API body structure** — resource properties go in a ``body`` block
  using the ARM REST API schema.  Managed identities and RBAC role assignments
  are also ``azapi_resource`` declarations.
* **Cross-stage references** — use ``data "azapi_resource"`` with
  ``resource_id`` variables instead of hardcoded names or ``terraform_remote_state``.
* **``versions.tf`` blocked** — ``_BLOCKED_FILES`` in the build session
  prevents generation of ``versions.tf``; all provider configuration must go in
  ``providers.tf`` to avoid Terraform's "duplicate required_providers" error.

Azapi-aligned Bicep generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Pinned Azure API version for Bicep** — ``BicepAgent.get_system_messages()``
  injects the same ``_AZURE_API_VERSION`` so all resource type declarations use
  a consistent API version (e.g. ``Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2025-06-01``).
* **Azure Verified Modules** — Bicep agent prefers AVM modules from the public
  Bicep registry where available.
* **Learn docs reference** — agent prompt includes the URL pattern for Azure
  ARM template reference docs with ``?pivots=deployment-language-bicep``.

Enterprise Copilot endpoint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Migrated to ``api.enterprise.githubcopilot.com``** — the enterprise endpoint
  exposes the full model catalogue (Claude, GPT, and Gemini families) whereas
  the public endpoint only returned a subset of GPT models.
* **``COPILOT_BASE_URL`` env var** — allows overriding the base URL for
  testing or on-premises environments.
* **Dynamic model discovery** — ``CopilotProvider.list_models()`` queries
  the ``/models`` endpoint at runtime; falls back to a curated list on failure.
* **Default model changed** — ``claude-sonnet-4`` replaces ``claude-sonnet-4.5``
  as the default across the Copilot provider and factory.
* **Timeout increased** — default request timeout raised from 120 s to 300 s
  to accommodate large architecture generation prompts.
* **Editor headers updated** — ``User-Agent``, ``Copilot-Integration-Id``,
  ``Editor-Version``, and ``Editor-Plugin-Version`` now match the official
  Copilot CLI (``copilot/0.0.410``).
* **Gemini routing** — ``_COPILOT_ONLY_PREFIXES`` in ``factory.py`` now
  includes ``"gemini-"`` alongside ``"claude-"``, enforcing that Gemini models
  are only routed via the Copilot provider.

Model catalogue expansion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **MODELS.md** — comprehensive model reference documenting all three provider
  families:

  - **Anthropic Claude** (8 models): Sonnet 4 / 4.5 / 4.6, Opus 4.5 / 4.6 /
    4.6-fast / 4.6-1m, Haiku 4.5.
  - **OpenAI GPT** (10 models): GPT-5.3 Codex through GPT-5-mini, GPT-4.1
    (1M context), GPT-4o-mini.
  - **Google Gemini** (2 models): Gemini 3 Pro Preview, Gemini 2.5 Pro
    (1M context).

* **Per-stage model recommendations** — guidance on optimal model selection
  by stage (design, build, deploy, analyze, docs).
* **Provider comparison table** — authentication, data residency, SLA, and
  cost comparison across copilot, github-models, and azure-openai.

Per-stage QA with remediation loop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Automatic per-stage QA** — infra, data, integration, and app stages now
  receive QA review immediately after generation (not just at the end of the
  build).
* **Remediation loop** — when QA identifies issues, the IaC agent regenerates
  the affected stage with QA findings appended as fix instructions.  Up to 2
  remediation attempts per stage (``_MAX_STAGE_REMEDIATION_ATTEMPTS``).
* **Inline Terraform validation** — ``_validate_terraform_stage()`` runs
  ``terraform init -backend=false`` + ``terraform validate`` per stage; errors
  are surfaced as ``## Terraform Validation Error (MUST FIX)`` in the QA task.
* **Advisory QA pass** — after all stages pass per-stage QA, an additional
  high-level advisory review runs (security, scalability, cost, production
  readiness).  Advisory findings are informational only — no regeneration.
* **Knowledge contributions** — QA findings are automatically submitted to the
  knowledge base (fire-and-forget) after both per-stage and advisory reviews.

QA engineer enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Azapi-aware review** — QA agent validates that all Terraform resources use
  ``azapi_resource`` with the correct API version in the ``type`` property.
* **Mandatory review checklist** — authentication & identity completeness,
  cross-stage reference correctness, script completeness (``set -euo pipefail``,
  error handling, output export), output completeness, structural consistency,
  code completeness, and Terraform file structure (single ``terraform {}``
  block in ``providers.tf``).
* **Image/screenshot support** — ``execute_with_image()`` accepts vision API
  input for analyzing error screenshots; falls back to text-only if vision
  fails.

Tool-calling support across all providers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **``ToolCall`` dataclass** — new first-class abstraction in ``provider.py``
  with ``id``, ``name``, and ``arguments`` fields.
* **``AIMessage`` extensions** — ``tool_calls: list[ToolCall] | None`` for
  assistant messages requesting tool invocations, ``tool_call_id: str | None``
  for tool result messages (``role="tool"``).
* **``AIProvider.chat(tools=...)``** — all three providers (copilot,
  github-models, azure-openai) accept OpenAI function-calling format tools
  and return ``tool_calls`` in ``AIResponse``.  Fully backward compatible.
* **``_messages_to_dicts()``** — each provider now has a dedicated helper
  for serializing tool call fields into OpenAI-compatible message dicts.

0.1.1-preview
++++++++++++++

v0.1.1 polish pass
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Unified ``_DONE_WORDS``** — all four interactive sessions (discovery,
  build, deploy, backlog) now accept ``done``, ``finish``, ``accept``, and
  ``lgtm`` as session-ending inputs.  Previously discovery/build lacked
  ``finish`` and deploy/backlog lacked ``accept``/``lgtm``.
* **Agent list updated** — help text now lists all 11 built-in agents
  (was 9; added ``security-reviewer`` and ``monitoring-agent``).
* **Bare ``print()`` eliminated** — ``deploy_stage.py`` status and reset
  paths now use ``console.print_info()`` / ``print_success()``.
  ``file_extractor.py`` verbose output uses ``print_fn`` callback.
* **Validation script output** — ``policies/validate.py`` and
  ``templates/validate.py`` now use ``sys.stdout.write()`` for consistent
  non-emoji output in CI environments.
* **Backlog state persistence** — ``BacklogSession`` now calls
  ``save()`` after generating items and after each interactive mutation.
* **Deploy state persistence** — ``DeploySession`` now calls ``save()``
  after ``mark_stage_deployed()`` so progress survives crashes.
* **Build failure feedback** — ``BuildSession`` now prints a visible
  warning before routing agent failures to QA, so the user is aware of
  the issue.
* **DEFERRED.md** — all 5 deferred items marked as completed with
  implementation references.
* **HISTORY.rst** — changelog entries added for Phases 7–10.

MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Handler-based plugin pattern** — ``MCPHandler`` ABC in ``mcp/base.py``
  owns transport, auth, and protocol.  ``MCPHandlerConfig`` declares name,
  stage/agent scoping, timeouts, and retry limits.
* **``MCPRegistry``** — builtin/custom resolution following the same
  pattern as ``AgentRegistry``.
* **``MCPManager``** — lifecycle management with lazy connect, tool
  routing, and circuit breaker (3 consecutive errors disables a handler).
  Used as a context manager for clean shutdown.
* **OpenAI function-calling bridge** —
  ``MCPManager.get_tools_as_openai_schema()`` converts MCP tool
  definitions to the OpenAI ``tools`` format for all three AI providers.
* **AI provider tool support** — ``ToolCall`` dataclass, ``tools``
  parameter on ``AIProvider.chat()``, ``tool_calls`` on
  ``AIMessage``/``AIResponse``.  All three providers (copilot,
  github-models, azure-openai) support tool calls with backward
  compatibility.
* **Agent tool-call loop** — ``BaseAgent._enable_mcp_tools = True``
  (default) with ``_max_tool_iterations = 10``.  Agents receive scoped
  tools, detect tool calls in AI responses, invoke via ``MCPManager``,
  feed results back, and loop until the model stops calling tools.
* **Custom handler loader** — ``mcp/loader.py`` discovers handlers from
  ``.prototype/mcp/`` Python files.  Filename convention:
  ``lightpanda_handler.py`` → handler name ``lightpanda``.
* **Scoping** — per-stage (``stages: ["build", "deploy"]`` or null for
  all) and per-agent (``agents: ["terraform-agent"]`` or null for all).
* **Example handler** — ``mcp/examples/lightpanda_handler.py`` provides
  a JSON-RPC over HTTP reference implementation.
* **Configuration** — ``mcp.servers`` list in ``prototype.yaml``;
  ``mcp.servers`` in ``SECRET_KEY_PREFIXES`` for credential isolation.

Anti-pattern detection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Post-generation scanning** — ``governance/anti_patterns/`` detects
  common issues in generated IaC code *after* generation, independent
  of the policy engine.  User decides: accept, override, or regenerate.
* **9 domains**: security, networking, authentication, storage,
  containers, encryption, monitoring, cost, and **completeness**
  (disabled-auth-without-identity, hardcoded cross-stage refs,
  incomplete scripts).
* **API** — ``load()`` → ``list[AntiPatternCheck]``,
  ``scan(text)`` → ``list[str]``, ``reset_cache()``.
* **Governance integration** — ``governance.py`` delegates to
  ``anti_patterns.scan()`` for violation detection.
  ``reset_caches()`` clears all three governance caches (policies,
  templates, anti-patterns).

Standards system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Curated design principles & reference patterns** —
  ``governance/standards/`` provides prescriptive guidance injected
  into agent system prompts via ``_include_standards`` flag.
* **7 standards files** across 4 directories:
  ``principles/`` (design, coding), ``terraform/`` (modules),
  ``bicep/`` (modules), ``application/`` (python, dotnet).
* **Terraform standards** — TF-001 through TF-010: module structure,
  naming, variables, outputs, cross-stage remote state (TF-006),
  backend consistency (TF-007), complete outputs (TF-008), robust
  deploy.sh (TF-009), companion resources (TF-010).
* **Bicep standards** — BCP-001 through BCP-008: module structure,
  parameters, outputs, cross-stage params (BCP-006), robust deploy.sh
  (BCP-007), companion resources (BCP-008).
* **Application standards** — Python and .NET patterns for
  Azure-deployed applications.
* **Selective injection** — ``_include_standards = False`` on
  cost-analyst, qa-engineer, doc-agent, project-manager, and
  biz-analyst (non-IaC agents).
* **API** — ``load()`` → ``list[Standard]``,
  ``format_for_prompt()`` → ``str``, ``reset_cache()``.

Policy expansion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **13 built-in policies** (was 9 at 0.1.0) — 4 new Azure service
  policies added: App Service, Storage, Functions, and Monitoring.

Build QA remediation loop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Automatic QA → IaC agent remediation** — after QA review identifies
  issues in generated code, ``_identify_affected_stages()`` determines
  which build stages are affected and regenerates them with QA findings
  appended as fix instructions.
* **Architect-first stage identification** — affected stages are
  identified by asking the architect agent first; falls back to regex
  matching on failure.
* **Re-review after remediation** — QA re-reviews remediated code and
  reports only remaining issues.  Knowledge contribution happens on the
  final QA output (after remediation).

Cross-tenant and service principal deploy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Service principal authentication** — ``--service-principal``,
  ``--client-id``, ``--client-secret``, ``--tenant-id`` parameters on
  ``az prototype deploy``.  SP credentials route to
  ``prototype.secrets.yaml`` via ``deploy.service_principal`` prefix.
* **Cross-tenant targeting** — ``--tenant`` parameter sets the
  deployment subscription context.  Preflight ``_check_tenant()`` warns
  when the active tenant differs from the target.
* **Deploy helpers** — ``login_service_principal()``,
  ``set_deployment_context()``, ``get_current_tenant()`` in
  ``deploy_helpers.py``.
* **``/login`` slash command** — runs ``az login`` interactively within
  the deploy session; suggests ``/preflight`` afterward to re-validate
  prerequisites.

Agent governance — Phases 8–10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **QA-first error routing** — shared ``route_error_to_qa()`` function
  in ``stages/qa_router.py`` used by all four interactive sessions
  (discovery, build, deploy, backlog).  QA agent diagnoses, tokens are
  recorded, and knowledge contributions fire-and-forget.
* **Agent delegation priority** — ``registry.find_agent_for_task()``
  implements the formal priority chain from CLAUDE.md: error→QA,
  service+IaC→terraform/bicep, scope→PM, multi-service→architect,
  discovery→biz, docs→doc, cost→cost, fallback→keyword scoring→PM.
  Backward-compatible with ``find_best_for_task()``.
* **Escalation tracking** — ``EscalationTracker`` in
  ``stages/escalation.py`` persists to
  ``.prototype/state/escalation.yaml``.  Four-level chain:
  L1 (documented) → L2 (architect/PM) → L3 (web search) → L4 (human).
  ``should_auto_escalate()`` checks timeout (default 120 s).
* **Backlog ``/add`` enrichment** — PM agent creates structured items
  via ``_enrich_new_item()``; bare fallback if AI unavailable.
* **Architect-driven stage identification** —
  ``_identify_affected_stages()`` asks architect agent first, falls back
  to regex on failure.
* **Build, deploy, backlog sessions** all create ``EscalationTracker``
  in ``__init__``.

Runtime documentation access — Phase 7
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Web search skill** — agents emit ``[SEARCH: query]`` markers;
  framework intercepts and fetches results from Microsoft Learn / web
  search.  Results injected as context for the next AI call.
  Max 3 markers resolved per turn.
* **Search caching** — ``SearchCache`` in ``knowledge/search_cache.py``
  with in-memory TTL cache (30 min, 50 entries, LRU eviction).  Shared
  across agents via ``AgentContext._search_cache``.
* **POC vs. production annotations** — ``compose_context(mode="poc")``
  strips ``## Production Backlog Items`` from service knowledge files.
  ``extract_production_items(service)`` returns bullet list for backlog
  generation.
* **5 agents enabled**: cloud-architect, terraform-agent, bicep-agent,
  app-developer, qa-engineer.

Community knowledge contributions — Phase 6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **``az prototype knowledge contribute``** — New command to submit
  knowledge base contributions as GitHub Issues.  Interactive by default;
  non-interactive via ``--service`` + ``--description`` or ``--file``.
  ``--draft`` previews without submitting.
* **``KnowledgeContributor`` module** — Module-level functions following
  ``backlog_push.py`` pattern: ``check_knowledge_gap()``,
  ``format_contribution_body/title()``, ``submit_contribution()``,
  ``build_finding_from_qa()``, ``submit_if_gap()``.
* **Auto-submission hooks** — Fire-and-forget knowledge contributions
  after QA diagnosis in deploy failures (``DeploySession``) and build
  QA review (``BuildSession``).  Silently submits when a gap is detected;
  never prompts or blocks the user.
* **GitHub Issue template** — Structured form at
  ``.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/knowledge-contribution.yml`` with Type,
  Target File, Section, Context, Rationale, Content to Add, and Source
  fields.  Labels: ``knowledge-contribution``, ``service/{name}``, type.

Token status display — Phase 5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **``TokenTracker``** — Accumulates ``AIResponse.usage`` across turns.
  Tracks this-turn, session-total, and budget-percentage.  Model context
  window lookup for 11 models.
* **Session integration** — Token status rendered as dim right-justified
  line after AI responses in all 4 interactive sessions:
  ``DiscoverySession``, ``BuildSession``, ``DeploySession``,
  ``BacklogSession``.
* **``Console.print_token_status()``** — Right-justified muted text
  renderer for token usage information.

Agent quality & knowledge system — Phase 4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **``security-reviewer`` agent** — Pre-deployment IaC scanning for RBAC
  over-privilege, public endpoints, missing encryption, hardcoded secrets.
  Reports findings as BLOCKERs (must fix) or WARNINGs (can defer).
  Knowledge-backed via ``roles/security-reviewer.md``.
* **``monitoring-agent``** — Generates Azure Monitor alerts, diagnostic
  settings, Application Insights config, and dashboards.  POC-appropriate
  (failure alerts, latency, resource health).  Knowledge-backed via
  ``roles/monitoring.md``.
* **``AgentContract``** — Formal input/output contracts on all 11 agents.
  Declares artifact dependencies (``inputs``), produced artifacts
  (``outputs``), and delegation targets (``delegates_to``).
  ``AgentOrchestrator.check_contracts()`` validates contract satisfaction.
* **Parallel execution** — ``AgentOrchestrator.execute_plan_parallel()``
  runs independent tasks concurrently via ``ThreadPoolExecutor``.
  Builds dependency graph from agent contracts; respects artifact
  ordering.  Diamond and pipeline patterns supported.
* **New capabilities** — ``SECURITY_REVIEW`` and ``MONITORING`` added to
  ``AgentCapability`` enum.  11 built-in agents (was 9).
* **58 new tests** — SecurityReviewerAgent (10), MonitoringAgent (8),
  registry integration (8), AgentContract (6+10), orchestrator contract
  validation (5), parallel execution (7), knowledge templates (4).

Agent commands hardening
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Rich UI for all agent commands** — ``agent list``, ``agent show``,
  ``agent add``, ``agent override``, and ``agent remove`` now use
  ``console.*`` styled output (header, success, info, dim, file_list).
* ``--json`` / ``-j`` flag on ``agent list`` and ``agent show`` returns
  raw dicts for scripting.  ``--detailed`` / ``-d`` expands capability
  details (list) or shows full system prompt (show).
* **Interactive agent creation** — ``agent add`` defaults to an
  interactive walkthrough (description, role, capabilities, constraints,
  system prompt, examples) matching the pattern of design/build/deploy.
  Non-interactive via ``--file`` or ``--definition``.
* **``agent update``** — modify custom agent properties.  Interactive
  by default with current values as defaults.  Field flags
  (``--description``, ``--capabilities``, ``--system-prompt-file``)
  for targeted non-interactive changes.
* **``agent test``** — send a test prompt to any agent, display the
  response with model and token count.  Default prompt:
  "Briefly introduce yourself and describe your capabilities."
* **``agent export``** — export any agent (including built-in) as a
  portable YAML file for sharing or customization.
* **Override validation** — ``agent override`` now verifies the file
  exists, parses as valid YAML with a ``name`` field, and warns if the
  target is not a known built-in agent.
* **Comprehensive help text** — all 8 agent commands have long-summaries
  with examples matching the depth of build/deploy/generate help.

Generate commands hardening
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Interactive backlog session** — ``az prototype generate backlog``
  now launches a conversational session (following the build/deploy
  ``Session`` pattern) where you can review, refine, add, update, and
  remove backlog items before pushing to your provider.
* **Backlog push to GitHub** — ``/push`` creates GitHub Issues via
  ``gh`` CLI with task checklists, acceptance criteria, and effort
  labels.
* **Backlog push to Azure DevOps** — ``/push`` creates Features /
  User Stories / Tasks via ``az boards`` with parent-child linking.
* **BacklogState persistence** — backlog items, push status, and
  conversation history are stored in
  ``.prototype/state/backlog.yaml`` for re-entrant sessions.
* **Scope-aware backlog** — in-scope items become stories,
  out-of-scope items are excluded, and deferred items get a separate
  "Deferred / Future Work" epic.
* **``--quick`` flag** — lighter generate → confirm → push flow
  without the interactive loop.
* **``--refresh`` flag** — force fresh AI generation, bypassing
  cached items.
* **``--status`` flag** — show current backlog state without
  starting a session.
* **``--push`` flag** — in quick mode, auto-push after generation.
* **AI-populated docs/speckit** — when design context is available,
  the doc-agent fills template ``[PLACEHOLDER]`` values with real
  content from the architecture.  Falls back to static rendering
  if no design context or AI is unavailable.
* **Rich UI** for ``generate docs``, ``generate speckit``, and
  ``generate backlog`` — bare ``print()`` / emoji replaced with
  ``console.print_header()``, ``print_success()``, ``print_info()``,
  ``print_file_list()``, and ``print_dim()``.
* **Project manager scope awareness** — agent prompt updated with
  scope boundary rules for in-scope, out-of-scope, and deferred
  items.
* **Telemetry overrides** — ``backlog_provider``, ``output_format``,
  and ``items_pushed`` attached to backlog command telemetry.

Init command hardening
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* ``--location`` is now **required** (no default). Enforced with
  ``CLIError`` when missing.
* ``--environment`` parameter added (``dev`` / ``staging`` / ``prod``,
  default ``dev``). Sets ``project.environment`` in config.
* ``--model`` parameter added. Overrides the provider-based default
  model (``claude-sonnet-4.5`` for copilot, ``gpt-4o`` for others).
* **Idempotency check** — if the target directory already contains a
  ``prototype.yaml``, the user is prompted before overwriting.
* **Conditional GitHub auth** — ``gh`` authentication and Copilot
  license validation are skipped when ``--ai-provider azure-openai``
  is selected. The ``gh_installed`` guard is no longer unconditional.
* **Rich UI** — bare ``print()`` / emoji output replaced with
  ``console.print_header()``, ``print_success()``, ``print_warning()``,
  ``print_file_list()``, and a summary ``panel()`` at completion.

Config commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **``az prototype config get``** — new command to retrieve a single
  configuration value by dot-separated key. Secret values are masked
  as ``***``.
* **``config show`` secret masking** — values stored in
  ``prototype.secrets.yaml`` (API keys, subscription IDs, tokens) are
  now masked as ``***`` in the output.
* **``config init`` marks init complete** — ``stages.init.completed``
  and timestamp are now set when using ``config init``, so downstream
  guards pass without requiring ``az prototype init``.
* **``config init`` Rich UI** — bare ``print()`` / emoji replaced
  with ``console.print_header()``, ``print_info()``, ``print_dim()``,
  ``panel()``, ``print_success()``, and ``print_file_list()``.
* **``config set`` validation** — ``project.iac_tool`` (must be
  ``terraform`` or ``bicep``) and ``project.location`` (must be a
  known Azure region) are now validated at set time with helpful error
  messages.

Enriched status command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* ``az prototype status`` now reads all three stage state files
  (``discovery.yaml``, ``build.yaml``, ``deploy.yaml``) to display
  real progress — not just boolean completion flags.
* **Default mode** — Rich console summary showing project config,
  per-stage progress with counts (exchanges, confirmed items, stages
  accepted, files generated, stages deployed/failed/rolled back), and
  pending file changes.
* ``--detailed`` / ``-d`` — expanded per-stage detail using existing
  state formatters (open/confirmed items, build stage breakdown,
  deploy stage status, deployment history).
* ``--json`` / ``-j`` — enriched machine-readable dict (superset of
  old format) with new fields: ``environment``, ``naming_strategy``,
  ``project_id``, ``deployment_history``, and per-stage detail counts.
* Surfaces previously hidden config fields: project ID, environment,
  and naming strategy.
* Deployment history from ``ChangeTracker`` included in output.

Telemetry enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* ``parameters`` field — the ``@track`` decorator now forwards
  sanitized command kwargs as a JSON-serialised dict.  Sensitive
  values (``subscription``, ``token``, ``api_key``, ``password``,
  ``secret``, ``key``, ``connection_string``) are redacted to
  ``***`` before transmission.
* ``error`` field — on command failure the exception type and
  message are captured (e.g. ``CLIError: Resource group not found``)
  and sent alongside ``success=false``, truncated to 1 KB.
* Both fields are conditional — omitted from the envelope when
  empty, so successful commands incur no additional payload.
* **Interactive command telemetry** — the ``@track`` decorator now
  reads ``cmd._telemetry_overrides`` (a ``dict``) so that commands
  which collect values via interactive prompts (e.g. ``config init``)
  can forward the chosen values to telemetry.  Overrides take
  precedence over kwargs and are merged into the ``parameters`` field.
* ``init`` and ``config init`` now attach resolved configuration
  values (``location``, ``ai_provider``, ``model``, ``iac_tool``,
  ``environment``, and for ``config init`` also ``naming_strategy``)
  as telemetry overrides after execution / interactive wizard
  completes.

Analyze command hardening
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* ``analyze costs`` results are now **cached** in
  ``.prototype/state/cost_analysis.yaml``.  Re-running the command
  returns the cached result unless the design context changes.
  Use ``--refresh`` to force a fresh analysis.
* AI temperatures lowered to 0.0 in the cost analyst agent for
  deterministic output.
* Rich UI for ``analyze error`` and ``analyze costs`` — emoji-free
  styled output using ``console.print_header()``, ``print_info()``,
  ``print_success()``, and ``print_agent_response()``.
* ``analyze error`` shows a soft warning when no design context is
  available (analysis still proceeds with reduced accuracy).
* ``_load_design_context()`` now checks 3 sources in priority order:
  ``design.json``, ``discovery.yaml`` (via ``DiscoveryState``), then
  ``ARCHITECTURE.md``.  Previously only checked source 1 and 3.

Deploy subcommand hardening
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Rich UI for ``deploy outputs``, ``deploy rollback-info``, and
  ``deploy generate-scripts`` — emoji-free styled output using
  ``console.*`` methods.
* Empty-state warnings for ``deploy outputs`` and
  ``deploy rollback-info`` when no deployment data exists.

0.1.0-preview
++++++++++++++

**Initial release** of the ``az prototype`` Azure CLI extension — an
AI-driven prototyping engine that takes you from idea to deployed Azure
infrastructure in four stages: ``init → design → build → deploy``.

Stage pipeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Four-stage workflow: **init**, **design**, **build**, **deploy** — each
  re-entrant with prerequisite guards and persistent state tracking.
* Organic, multi-turn **discovery conversation** with joint
  ``biz-analyst`` + ``cloud-architect`` perspectives in a single session
  — captures requirements with architectural feasibility feedback.
* **Cost awareness** during discovery — surfaces pricing models and
  relative cost comparisons when discussing Azure service choices.
* **Template-aware discovery** — suggests matching workload templates
  when user requirements align with a known pattern.
* **Explicit prototype scoping** — tracks in-scope, out-of-scope, and
  deferred items throughout discovery for downstream backlog and
  documentation generation.
* **Structured requirements extraction** — heading-based parser reliably
  extracts goals, requirements, constraints, scope, and services from
  the agent summary.
* Interactive design refinement loop with ``--interactive`` flag.
* **Binary artifact support** — ``--artifacts`` accepts PDF, DOCX, PPTX,
  XLSX, and image files; documents have text extracted and embedded
  images sent via the vision API.

Agent system
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **9 built-in agents**: cloud-architect, biz-analyst, app-developer,
  bicep-agent, terraform-agent, doc-agent, qa-engineer, cost-analyst,
  project-manager.
* Three-tier agent resolution: **custom → override → built-in** — users
  can replace or extend any agent via YAML or Python definitions.
* ``az prototype agent`` command group for listing, adding, overriding,
  showing, and removing agents.

AI providers
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **GitHub Models**, **Azure OpenAI**, and **GitHub Copilot** backends
  with provider allowlisting — non-Azure providers are blocked.
* Streaming support for all providers.
* Managed identity and API key authentication for Azure OpenAI.
* Copilot Business / Enterprise license validation.

Policy-driven governance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* ``PolicyEngine`` loads ``*.policy.yaml`` files with severity levels
  (required / recommended / optional) across 6 categories.
* **9 built-in policies**: Container Apps, Cosmos DB, Key Vault, SQL
  Database, Managed Identity, Network Isolation, APIM-to-Container-Apps,
  Authentication, Data Protection.
* ``GovernanceContext`` automatically injects compact policy summaries
  into every agent's system prompt — agents are governance-aware by
  default.
* Policy conflicts surfaced during discovery; user may accept or
  override with full audit tracking.
* Custom policies via ``.prototype/policies/`` directory.

Workload templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **5 built-in templates**: web-app, serverless-api, microservices,
  ai-app, data-pipeline — each defines Azure services, connections,
  defaults, and requirements seeds.
* Template schema validation (``template.schema.json``).
* Custom templates via ``.prototype/templates/`` directory.

Interactive deploy stage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Interactive by default** — Claude Code-inspired bordered prompts,
  progress indicators, and conversational deployment session following
  the ``BuildSession`` pattern.
* **7-phase orchestration**: load build state → plan overview →
  preflight checks → stage-by-stage deploy → output capture → deploy
  report → interactive loop.
* **Preflight checks** — validates subscription, IaC tool (Terraform
  or Bicep), resource group, and required Azure resource providers
  before deploying; surfaces fix commands for common issues.
* **Deploy state persistence** — ``DeployState`` (YAML at
  ``.prototype/state/deploy.yaml``) tracks per-stage deployment
  status, preflight results, deploy/rollback audit trail, captured
  outputs, and conversation history.  Supports ``--reset`` to clear
  and ``--status`` to display progress without starting a session.
* **Ordered rollback** — cannot roll back stage N while a higher-
  numbered stage is still deployed; ``/rollback all`` enforces
  reverse order automatically.
* **QA-first error routing** — deployment failures route to
  ``qa-engineer`` for diagnosis before offering retry/skip/rollback.
* **Slash commands** during deploy: ``/status``, ``/stages``,
  ``/deploy [N|all]``, ``/rollback [N|all]``, ``/redeploy N``,
  ``/plan N``, ``/outputs``, ``/preflight``, ``/help``.
* **Dry-run mode** — ``--dry-run`` runs Terraform plan / Bicep
  What-If without executing; combinable with ``--stage N`` for
  per-stage preview.
* **Single-stage deploy** — ``--stage N`` deploys one stage
  non-interactively.
* **Output capture** — persists Terraform / Bicep outputs to JSON and
  exports ``PROTOTYPE_*`` environment variables.
* **Deploy script generation** — auto-generates ``deploy.sh`` for
  webapp, container-app, and function deploy types.
* **Rollback primitives** — ``terraform destroy`` and Bicep resource
  deletion with pre-deploy snapshots.

Documentation & analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **6 doc templates**: ARCHITECTURE, AS_BUILT, COST_ESTIMATE,
  DEPLOYMENT, CONFIGURATION, DEVELOPMENT — generated via ``doc-agent``.
* ``az prototype generate speckit`` — full spec-kit documentation
  bundle.
* ``az prototype generate backlog`` — generates user stories from
  architecture.
* ``az prototype analyze error`` — AI-powered error diagnosis with
  fix recommendations.
* ``az prototype analyze costs`` — cost estimation at Small / Medium /
  Large t-shirt sizes.

Configuration & naming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* ``ProjectConfig`` manages ``prototype.yaml`` + ``prototype.secrets.yaml``
  (git-ignored) with Azure-only endpoint validation and sensitive-key
  isolation.
* ``az prototype config init`` — interactive setup wizard.
* **4 naming strategies**: Microsoft ALZ, Microsoft CAF, simple,
  enterprise — plus fully custom patterns for consistent resource naming.

Interactive build stage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Interactive by default** — Claude Code-inspired bordered prompts,
  spinners, progress indicators, and conversational review loop.
* **Fine-grained deployment staging** — each infrastructure component,
  database system, and application gets its own dependency-ordered stage.
* **Template matching** — workload templates are optional starting points
  scored by service overlap with the design architecture (>30% threshold);
  multiple templates can match; empty match is valid.
* **Computed resource names** — each service in the deployment plan
  carries its resolved name (via naming strategy), ARM resource type,
  and SKU.
* **Per-stage policy enforcement** — ``PolicyResolver`` checks generated
  code against governance policies after each stage; violations resolved
  conversationally (accept compliant / override with justification /
  regenerate).
* **Build state persistence** — ``BuildState`` (YAML at
  ``.prototype/state/build.yaml``) tracks deployment plan, generation
  log, policy checks, overrides, review decisions, and conversation
  history.  Supports ``--reset`` to clear and ``--status`` to display
  progress without starting a session.
* **QA review** — cross-cutting QA agent review of all generated code
  after staged generation completes.
* **Build report** — styled summary showing templates used, IaC tool,
  per-stage status (files, resources, policy results), and totals.
* **Review loop** — feedback targets specific stages or cross-cutting
  concerns; AI regenerates affected stages with policy re-check.
* **Slash commands** during build: ``/status``, ``/stages``, ``/files``,
  ``/policy``, ``/help``, ``done`` / ``accept``, ``quit``.
* **Multi-resource telemetry** — ``track_build_resources()`` sends array
  of ``{resourceType, sku}`` pairs with backward-compatible scalar
  fields for the first resource.

Telemetry
~~~~~~~~~
* Application Insights integration (``opencensus-ext-azure``) with
  ``@track`` decorator on all commands.
* Fields: ``commandName``, ``tenantId``, ``provider``, ``model``,
  ``resourceType``, ``location``, ``sku``, ``extensionVersion``,
  ``success``, ``timestamp``.
